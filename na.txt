Definitely! Here's how you can add a spinning animation to the wheel using CSS:

1. First, we need to add a `transition` property to the `.wheel` element in the CSS code. This property will allow us to smoothly rotate the wheel when the user clicks the spin button. Add the following code to the existing `.wheel` styles:

```
.wheel {
  /* existing styles */
  transition: transform 5s ease-out;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
```

The `transition` property indicates that we want to animate the `transform` property, which is what we'll use to rotate the wheel. The `ease-out` value makes the animation start fast and slow down gradually towards the end. The `transform-style: preserve-3d` property is needed to ensure that the wheel doesn't become distorted during the animation.

2. Next, we need to define a new class that will be applied to the `.wheel` element when the user clicks the spin button. This class will use the `transform` property to rotate the wheel. Add the following CSS code to the existing styles:

```
.wheel.spinning {
  transform: rotateX(720deg) rotateZ(720deg);
}
```

This code defines a new class `.spinning` which uses the `transform` property to rotate the wheel 720 degrees around the x and z axes. You can adjust the degree values to control the speed and direction of the animation.

3. Finally, we need to modify the `spinWheel` function in the JavaScript code to apply the `.spinning` class to the `.wheel` element when the user clicks the spin button. Here's the updated code:

```
function spinWheel() {
  // Get a random option from the array
  var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length);
  var selectedOption = options[randomIndex];
  
  // Show the notification and play the video
  showNotification(selectedOption);
  
  // Apply the spinning class to the wheel for a few seconds
  var wheel = document.querySelector(".wheel");
  wheel.classList.add("spinning");
  setTimeout(function() {
    wheel.classList.remove("spinning");
  }, 5000);
}
```

This code retrieves the `.wheel` element using `querySelector`, adds the `.spinning` class to it using `classList.add`, and then uses `setTimeout` to remove the class after 5 seconds (which matches the duration of the CSS `transition`). The `5000` value in `setTimeout` is the duration of the animation in milliseconds. 

And that should be it! With these changes, the wheel should now spin when the user clicks the spin button.
